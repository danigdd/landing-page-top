                    <p>
                        Studying full stack development is beneficial due to versatility and flexibility, allowing you to work on both client-side and server-side components, leading to higher demand, increased productivity, and better career growth.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 150px;">
                        This comprehensive skill set makes you a valuable asset for companies, enabling efficient problem-solving, quicker technical decisions, and the potential for higher salaries and leadership roles. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this path you will learn how to make the skeleton and styles of your web applications, along with fancy and elegant animations and 
                        interactions using JavaScript. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you advance into the course, you will learn how to connect all your components, how to make them "alive" and responsive to the web with the help of popular languages such as JavaScript (again), Java, Python, Go... The list goes on!
                    </p>
                    <div class="section-h1" style="margin-top: 180px;">Is it hard to learn?</div>
                    <div class="section-h2">
                        <p>
                            This course will have its own difficulties, like every other one! However, you will be guided and helped in every step of the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you learn, you will code your own mini-projects (like this website!) and you will encounter different challenges. Don't worry! - It will be normal! That is why the odin community exists: feel free to ask for help!
